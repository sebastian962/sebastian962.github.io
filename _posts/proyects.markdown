# Projects

## Monitoring System at CNRT

### Overview

At CNRT, I developed a new monitoring system using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, replacing an outdated system that relied on **Nagios**.

### Challenges

- **Agent Deployment**: Deployed monitoring agents across all servers.
- **Alert Thresholds**: Set up alert thresholds and communication channels.
- **Dashboards**: Created Grafana dashboards that added significant value to our organization.

### Key Advantages

1. **Proactive Monitoring**: Transitioned from a reactive to a proactive approach in handling server issues.
2. **Incident Management**: Improved the management of incidents.
3. **Perception Improvement**: Enhanced the perception of the IT department among other departments.

## Kubernetes Cluster Migration

### Overview

I migrated a Kubernetes cluster on **OpenShift** from version **3.1 to 3.11**. This was a critical system for the company, used by multiple clients, and required meticulous planning and execution to minimize downtime.

### Challenges

- **Personal Learning Curve**: I had limited experience with Kubernetes, adding an extra layer of difficulty to the project which had a strict deadline.
- **Short Maintenance Window**: The migration had to be completed within a minimal maintenance window.
- **Transparent Migration**: Ensured the migration was transparent to the clients.
- **Security and Platform Improvements**: Implemented security improvements and platform sanitation to avoid carrying over bad practices to the new cluster.

### Key Advantages

1. **Robust System**: Achieved a more robust and stable system.
2. **Lifecycle Extension**: Extended the lifecycle of the OpenShift version, which was nearing its end.
3. **Seamless Transition**: Successfully migrated the cluster with minimal disruption to services.
